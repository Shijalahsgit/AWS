## AWS

## What is AWS?
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud platform offered by Amazon that lets people and companies use IT services like storage, servers, and databases through the internet. 
Instead of buying and maintaining physical computers, you can "rent" these services online and only pay for what you use.
AWS provides tools to do it easily and quickly. It offers over 200 services such as 
EC2 for virtual servers
S3 for storing files 
RDS for managing databases
and Lambda to run code without servers.

## Why use AWS?
The below are the most important reasons for using AWS:

# 1. On-Demand Resources
With AWS, you donâ€™t need to set up your computers or servers. You can quickly use services like storage, databases, and virtual machines over the internet. 
It is like turning on a switch, use what you need, when you need it.

# 2. Pay-as-You-Go Pricing
AWS doesn't ask you to buy anything upfront. You are charged only for the time and the amount of services you use. 
If you use a server for 2 hours, you only pay for 2 hours. This helps save money and avoid waste.

# 3. Global Infrastructure
AWS has data centres across the globe. So, whether your users are in India, the US, or Europe your app can reach them quickly.
Also, if your business grows and you need more power or storage, AWS can easily scale up without downtime.

# 4. Reliability and Performance
AWS is built to be strong and dependable. It uses multiple backup systems, so even if one fails, others keep your data and apps running.
You get fast performance and high availability so your services rarely go down.

# 5. Everything from one Platform
In AWS, everything you need is available on one platform. You can launch virtual servers using Amazon EC2 to run your applications, store files and media using Amazon S3, and manage databases easily with Amazon RDS.
In addition to this, AWS allows you to analyze large amounts of data, build and run artificial intelligence models, and even host complete websites.
All these services are accessible from a single dashboard, making it simple to build, deploy, and manage projects without setting up any physical hardware.
